**MLfin.py** is an Advance Machine Learning toolbox for financial applications. The main ideas is using
proprietary works and code snippent by Dr. Marcos López de Prado to build a morden Pythonic package
that implements newest tech stacks from various libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Numba, and Scikit-Learn.
This work inspired by the library `MlFinLab <https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab>`_ by
**Hudson and Thames**. Unfortunately, the library is closed-source and I believe in the power of open
source projects, it motivates me to build this package from ground up.

Leverage best practice in packaging Python library, morden documentation style and comprehensive examples,
**MLfin.py** will be the great tool for Quant Researchers, Algorithmic Traders, and Data Scientists as well as
Finance students to reproduce the complex data transformation, labeling, sampling and feature engineering
techniques with ease.

Installation
============
Installation can then be done via pip:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install mlfinpy

For the sake of best practice, it is good to do this with a dependency manager. I suggest you
set yourself up with `poetry <https://github.com/sdispater/poetry>`_, then within a new poetry project
run:

.. code-block:: console

   poetry add mlfinpy

.. note::
    If any of these methods don't work, please `raise an issue
    <https://github.com/baobach/mlfinpy/issues>`_ with the ``packaging`` label on GitHub.

For developers
--------------

If you are planning on using Mlfinpy as a starting template for significant
modifications, it probably makes sense to clone the repository and to just use the
source code:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/baobach/mlfinpy

Alternatively, if you still want the convenience of a global ``from mlfinpy import x``,
you should try:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/baobach/mlfinpy.git

Work with HFT Data
==================
In reality, testing code snippets through the first 3 chapters of the book is challenging as it relies on HFT data to
create the new financial data structures. Sourcing the HFT data is very difficult and thus `TickData LLC`_ provides
the full history of S&P500 Emini futures tick data and available for purchase.

I am not affiliated with TickData in any way but would like to recommend others to make use of their service. The full
history costs $750 and is worth every penny. They have really done a great job at cleaning the data and providing
it in a user friendly manner.

.. _TickData LLC: https://www.tickdata.com/

Download Sources
----------------

TickData does offer about 20 days worth of raw tick data which can be sourced from their website `link`_.
For those of you interested in working with a two years of sample tick, volume, and dollar bars, it is provided for in
the `research repo`_. You should be able to work on a few implementations of the code with this set.

.. _link: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tick-data-s3/downloads/ES_Sample.zip
.. _research repo: https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research/tree/master/Sample-Data

.. note::
    Searching for free tick data can be a challenging task. The following three sources may help:

    1. `Dukascopy`_. Offers free historical tick data for some futures, though you do have to register.
    2. Most crypto exchanges offer tick data but not historical (see `Binance API`_). So you'd have to run a script for a few days.
    3. `Blog Post`_: How and why I got 75Gb of free foreign exchange “Tick” data.

    .. _Dukascopy: https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/
    .. _Binance API: https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md

Datasets
========

To make the developing module and testing the code process more convenient, **MLfin.py** package contains various financial
datasets which can be used by a developer as sandbox data.

Tick Data Sample
----------------

**MLfin.py** provides a sample of tick data for E-Mini S&P 500 futures which can be used to test bar compression algorithms,
microstructural features, etc. Tick data sample consists of ``Timestamp``, ``Price`` and ``Volume``. The data contain
500,000 rows of cleaned tick data.

.. py:currentmodule:: mlfinpy.dataset.load_datasets
.. autofunction:: load_tick_sample

Dollar-Bar Data Sample
----------------------
We also provide a sample of dollar bars for E-Mini S&P 500 futures. Data set structure:

    - Open price (open)
    - High price (high)
    - Low price (low)
    - Close price (close)
    - Volume (cum_volume)
    - Dollar volume traded (cum_dollar)
    - Number of ticks inside of bar (cum_ticks)

.. tip::
   You can find more information on dollar bars and other bar compression algorithms in :ref:`data-structure`.

.. py:currentmodule:: mlfinpy.dataset.load_datasets
.. autofunction:: load_dollar_bar_sample

ETF Prices Sample
-----------------

.. py:currentmodule:: mlfinpy.dataset.load_datasets
.. autofunction:: load_stock_prices

The data set consists of close prices for:

   * EEM, EWG, TIP, EWJ, EFA, IEF, EWQ, EWU, XLB, XLE, XLF, LQD, XLK, XLU, EPP,FXI, VGK, VPL, SPY,
     TLT, BND, CSJ, DIA
   * Starting from 2008 till 2016.

It can be used to test and validate portfolio optimization techniques.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

   from mlfinpy.datasets import (load_tick_sample, load_stock_prices, load_dollar_bar_sample)

   # Load sample tick data
   tick_df = load_tick_sample()
   # Load sample dollar bar data
   dollar_bars_df = load_dollar_bar_sample()
   # Load sample stock prices data
   stock_prices_df = load_stock_prices()

Project principles and design decisions
=======================================

- It should be easy to swap out individual components of each module
  with the user's proprietary improvements.
- Usability is everything: it is better to be self-explanatory than consistent.
- The goal is creating a framework to build a robust and functional library for
  machine learning applications.
- Everything that has been implemented should be tested and formatted with lattest
  requirements.
- Inline documentation is good: dedicated (separate) documentation is better.
  The two are not mutually exclusive.
- Formatting should never get in the way of good code: because of this,
  I have deferred **all** formatting decisions to `Black
  <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_, `Flake8
  <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_, and `Isort
  <https://github.com/PyCQA/isort>`_.
